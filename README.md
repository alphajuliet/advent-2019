## Day 1

A simple warm-up with an easy summed calculation in part 1, following by a recursive version in part 2 to find the converged value of a sequence.

## Day 2

Here we implement a little microcontroller with three instructions. Similar to Day 8 in Advent 2020, I did this as a state machine using a *reduce* function to step through the memory, updating the instruction pointer (ip) on the way.

For part 2, we need to step through the code with different seed values, to find which one gives the result we need.
